# Welcome to Project 3 for ZOOL710 at UH Manoa.

# My name is Jerry and I work on Maize Genetics.

# In our lab the project we are working on focuses on trying to make temperate 
# corn insensitive todaylength so that it can flower under the longer days in 
# temperate lattitudes and breeders can access and incroporate desireble traits 
# from the the highlydiverse tropical maize genome into temperate maize through 
# cross pollination. 

# Here in this project we'll explore the shedding and silking days
# of different maize lines grown in the Waimanalo research station. 

# First you're going to want to download the file to your correct folder, then
# navigate to the correct location where the file is. This is what it looks like
# for me:

#### TALK ABOUT THE VARIETES AND WHATS UNIQUE ABOUT EACH #####
