# Project Rubric

Your audience is the user, members of the R-literate general public who may want to use your data and/or code. To be useful, the code and documentation must be clear enough to guide naive users in fully reproducing the analysis. Naive users may not know anything about the project, or may even be yourself after enough time has passed or projects multiplied! 

Elements:
1. Your github repo, organized following the project template.
2. Your modified code, quarto, and README files, organized in the repo.
2. Your output files (any requested output, i.e., `.csv`, `.html`, `.docx`, `.pdf` files) in their proper places in the repo.

|Criteria| Evaluation| Scoring | Points | Comments |
|:---------|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|__Right__| Code runs without Error - Must be YES | 0/10 | 8 | |
|	  | Code produces correct output | 0-5 | 5 | |
|__Readable__| Code is readable (good use of white space, etc.) |0-5| 5 | |
|        | Code is understandable (good naming conventions, concise informative comments) |||  |
|__Reproducible__| READMEs document project organization | 0-5| 5 |  |
|        | READMEs explain the order to run the code/quarto in order to reproduce analysis| || |
|        | READMEs list contents of each directory | ||  |
|__Aesthetics__| Files are free of unnecessary clutter (assignment instructions, etc.) | 0-5 | 5 | |
|        | Code is elegant (not required, but a bonus) |  | | |
|__Bottom Line__| | 30 | 28 | |

BEAUTIFUL JOB! 

Very nice code. Elegant and straighforward. Very easy to understand and follow. Very logical.

Excellent use of code chunks in your R script and integration with quarto qmd. Love the html and website - makes the report so easy for everyone to read. 

The only issues you should continue to work on are:

1. Never include "install.packages()" in your script. Users can install IF THEY WISH. YOu should not do it to unsuspecting users like viruses. Also they may already have it installed. Finally it throws an error! (this was the only reason you lost points.)

2. Made some suggestions on your README. Please keep working on relative paths. They make code portable.  I think you just need to fix your Rstudio default settings. You can have R studio start in the correct working directory when you double click on a file. 

3. You only need to call "library(package)" ONCE per script. It remains in active memory throughout the session. 

4. I made some code edits (minor). Please review in the pull request. 

THANK YOU!

PRESENTATION was EXCELLENT!!! Well done!!! It was really fun to watch, and so convincing! You sourced your script right in front of us! Killer.
