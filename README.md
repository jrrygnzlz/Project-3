### Hi Everybody! My name is Gerardo (Jerry) Gonzalez and here is my Project 3.

I work on Maize Genetics so for this project I used Maize Flowering data from our Waimanalo Summer 2024 field tests.

This data compares the flowering time of tropical and temperate maize lines grown in the Waimainalo Summer 2024 field.
Temperate Lines: B73, Mo17, B104
Tropical Lines: Tzi8, Tzi9, CML10, CML258, CML277

The things you'll need to run the code and look at like the script, QMD, and data are right here on the front page.
It would be best to read the QMD and script side by side becasue the QMD has all the explanation.

First download the data, then put it in a new folder called project-3. Then you can copy and paste the script into your R and run it.
If there are errors, make sure to install the necessary packages, then try again. 

If you wanna see all that I did with good explantion and ina  clean format...check out my website! https://jrrygnzlz.github.io/Project-3/

Hope everyone is doing well! :)
